`oovu`
======

A modular performance framework for Max 6.

What is it?
-----------

`oovu` is a collection of externals and patchers for Max 6. `oovu` allows you
to quickly create structured patches. `oovu` organizes its components into
hierarchical modules where every component is addressable via OSC from anywhere
in the patch. `oovu` components support a variety of messages, and can be bound
to MIDI and keyboard events, as well as to other components and even to
automated patterns. `oovu` also allows for patching-free audio routing, and
automatically handles up- and down-mixing between modules with different
numbers of channels.

Installation
------------

Just copy the entire `oovu` project into your Max 6 `packages` directory.

Open the `oovu-overview` from Max's `extras` menu, and start exploring.

Or right-click in any patcher and "Paste From" > oovu!
